# Chapter D: An Ode to Short-Circuiting And

## Booleans

Now, it was very brief, but if it's possible you noticed that I called out `u1` in the previous section. `u1` represents, of course, a single bit. It's possible you were concerned that Zig relied on its arbitrary-bit-width integers in place of a fully realized boolean type. However, let your concerns be assuaged. Zig does have a boolean type.

```zig
const will_i_survive: boolean = false;
```

**YOU**: I wasn't concerned. In fact, wouldn't it be cool if Zig didn't have a boolean and just used `u1`?

But the clarity! It's much semantically correct to have a `u1` type for storing a single bit, 0 or 1, and a boolean type, for storing a true or false. Remember, type isn't just about internal representation, it's also about usage. A u1 can be added or subtracted or be acted on by bitwise operators, but it can't be used in conditionals. And a boolean can be used in a if statement, but it can't be added or subtracted or coerced to a number.

I want to run through some examples of these rules, to make them clear. All of these usages are okay:
```zig
const std_out = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
const door_unlocked = false;
if (!door_unlocked) {
    try std_out.writeAll("I'm trapped!");
}
var hp: u1 = 1;
hp -= 1;
// Explicit comparison can be used to convert from u1 to boolean
if (hp == 0) {
    try std_out.writeAll("I'm dead.");
}
// @intFromBool can be used to convert from boolean to int
const i_need_a_number: u1 = @intFromBool(door_unlocked);
try std_out.print("{}", .{ i_need_a_number }); // Prints 0
```

In contrast, all of these things are disallowed (thankfully):
```zig
if (1) { // Can't use number in condition
    try std_out.writeAll("Oh no.");
}
var my_truth = true;
my_truth -= 1; // Can't do math on boolean
const sanity = 0;
try std_out.print("{}", .{ !sanity }); // Can't invert a number
if (true || false) { // || isn't used for boolean or in Zig

}
```

**YOU**: Did I read that right? `true || false` isn't allowed? What's that about.

Well, that's a different issue. You understand the u1 versus boolean distinction?

**YOU**: Yeah, I guess.

I wouldn't be harping the point except that it's important. The two different data types have the same backing representation in the computer, and so they could be treated the same by the programming language or programmer (like in C). But they're semantically different. This is what I call "semantic programming"—writing code that most closely represents what you mean, not what's simplest or shortest or fastest or most explicit.

**YOU**: Okay so how do you do boolean or?

`or`.

**YOU**: Like Python? Like Lua!?

Yep. In most places Zig uses C-style syntax (like Java and C++ and JavaScript and similar). But there's a good reason why Zig diverges here. In these languages, operators, like +, -, & (bitwise and), << (left shift), etc are special characters. And keywords, like if, for, and while, effect control flow. Since Zig has short-circuiting `and` and `or`, they affect control flow—so they're keywords not operators.

**YOU**: Huh. Could remind me what short-circuiting means?

Sure. `and` only returns true if both sides are true. If the programming language evaluates the left side and it’s `false`, then it will skip evaluating the right side and return false.

```zig
fn returnsFalse() bool {
    std.debug.print("there is no hope");
    return false;
}

fn main () void {
    if (returnsFalse() and returnsFalse()) {
        std.debug.print("this is impossible.");
    }
}
```
This code example program will only once, since the second call to `returnsFalse` will be skipped.

For reference, `||` is used in Zig—it's used for combining error sets. Error sets are slightly beyond the scope of this guide. But if you use `||` instead of `or` and get an error about `||` needing comptime known arguments, it's because it's expecting an error set.

## Enums
Unlike numbers and booleans, which we've already talked about, enums are special because you can create your own types of enums. An Enum is a type which represents one of a set of possible values.

**YOU**: But isn't that true of all types?

Yes, sure. The first aspect of a type is that it defines a set of possible values. The difference with enums is that there are very few things that you can do with them. The primary operation that you can do with an enum is equality—checking if it is the same as another enum value.

Enums are normally used when you have a discrete and small known set of possible values, and you want to make sure that a variable is one of the values in the set. For example, my stoplight (you don't have a stoplight in your living room?) has three possible colors: red, yellow, and green. We can express these three states with an enum.

```zig
const StoplightColors = enum {
    red, yellow, green
};

pub fn main () void {
    const currentColor: StoplightColors = .red;
    @import("std").debug.assert(currentColor != .green);
}
```

In this example, we first create an enum, and list out all of our possible states. If you don't know all of your possible states, or there are too many to list, then an enum isn't a great choice. We then create a variable called `currentColor`, with type `StoplightColors`. Notice how `StoplightColors` is capitalized (PascalCase) because it's a user-created type. As mentioned, enums are kind of a one-trick pony. We can use `==` for equality or `!=` for inequality. In this example, we use `!=`.

Notice the leading `.` before the enum value. This is called enum-literal syntax. It only works when Zig can determine the type of the enum from context, which it can here because it knows the type of the `currentColor` variable. This leading `.` will continue to show up in Zig in other places. It means a couple different things, but when it's in front of an identifier like this, it means, "look this up in context."

## Unions

Zig has two types of unions, tagged and untagged. I'm only going to be talking about tagged unions, because they're vastly more useful. A tagged union has two parts.

First, it has a tag. The tag is an enum which represents the possible states the union can be in. Like enums, you can define your own unions, and when you do, you define what states your union can possibly be in. And again, like an enum, a union can only be in one state at a time (the tag keeps track of what state this is).

Unlike an enum, a union stores additional data. This data is the second part of a tagged union. The thing that makes union special is that they can change their shape. They can change what data they store depending on what state they're in. When you define a union type, you can define several different states, and a piece of data that you want the union to store when it's in each state. The pieces of data don't even have to be the same size!

```zig
// TODO: examples
// declaring a union with a f64 and a usize
// init as a float
// read as a float
// function that switches on the state and prints
// change to an int (destroying/overwriting the float data)
```
